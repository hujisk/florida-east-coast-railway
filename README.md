# Florida East Coast Railway: Key West Extension Project

## Project Charter

### Mission
The Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) is dedicated to connecting the entire state of Florida through innovative, resilient, and sustainable transportation infrastructure. Our mission is to enhance economic growth, facilitate commerce, and provide reliable passenger service across the region.

### Vision
We envision a seamless rail network that spans from Jacksonville to Key West, bridging communities, unlocking new economic opportunities, and establishing Florida as a global logistics hub. The Key West Extension represents the final, most ambitious leg of this vision—a testament to engineering prowess and strategic foresight.

### Key West Extension: The Grand Undertaking
This repository serves as the central planning and coordination hub for the monumental **Key West Extension Project**. The project will extend the FEC mainline south from its current terminus, traversing the unique challenges of the Florida Keys to reach the deep-water port of Key West.

### Objectives
1. **Connect the Florida Keys**: Build a resilient, all‑weather railway across the chain of islands.
2. **Establish a Deep‑Water Port Link**: Integrate rail service with Key West’s maritime facilities.
3. **Drive Regional Development**: Stimulate tourism, trade, and permanent settlement along the route.
4. **Set a New Standard for Over‑Water Rail Engineering**: Demonstrate innovative solutions for bridge construction, storm protection, and environmental stewardship.

### Project Governance
This repository will house all project documentation, design files, milestone tracking, and collaboration artifacts. Issues, pull requests, and branches will be used to simulate the phased execution of the extension, mirroring real‑world project‑management workflows.
