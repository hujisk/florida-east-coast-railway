# Survey Report: Florida East Coast Railway Extension to Marathon

**Survey Team:** FEC Engineering Corps, Coastal Division
**Survey Dates:** December 15–25, 2025
**Lead Surveyor:** J.P. Henderson

## Executive Summary
Our field teams have completed the initial topographic, hydrographic, and geotechnical surveys for the proposed rail extension from the existing terminus at Florida City to Marathon (approx. 45 miles). The route is feasible with moderate engineering challenges; recommended alignment follows the historic Overseas Railroad corridor where possible, with adaptations for modern standards and climate resilience.

## Proposed Station Locations
1. **Florida City Junction** (Milepost 0.0)
   - Existing FEC yard; upgrade required for increased traffic.
   - New passenger platform and expanded freight transfer facilities.

2. **Key Largo** (Milepost 15.2)
   - Station site: adjacent to US‑1, north of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park.
   - Serves as a regional hub for tourism and light industry.
   - Parking for 200 vehicles; potential hotel partnership.

3. **Islamorada** (Milepost 26.8)
   - Located near the historic Indian Key Fill.
   - Elevated station to protect against storm surge.
   - Includes a freight spur for local fishery and marine‑supply businesses.

4. **Long Key** (Milepost 34.5)
   - Station positioned on the Long Key Viaduct (re‑use of original pilings).
   - Scenic overlook for passengers; limited freight capability.

5. **Marathon Terminal** (Milepost 44.9)
   - Primary interim terminus; 40‑acre yard for rolling‑stock storage and maintenance.
   - Deep‑water barge dock for construction‑material delivery during subsequent phases.
   - Future connection to the Key West extension via the Seven‑Mile Bridge.

## Track Gradients and Curvature
- **Maximum Gradient:** 1.5% (compensated for curvature).
- **Minimum Curve Radius:** 1,500 feet on mainland; 2,000 feet on viaducts.
- **Super‑elevation:** 6 inches maximum on curves > 1,800‑ft radius.
- **Vertical Clearance:** 22 feet above mean high water for all bridges.

## Geotechnical Findings
- **Mainland Segment (Florida City–Key Largo):** Stable limestone bedrock, suitable for direct fixation.
- **Key Largo–Islamorada:** Sandy fill over coral rock; recommend driven piles for bridge abutments.
- **Islamorada–Long Key:** Existing railroad embankments in fair condition; require widening and armoring.
- **Long Key–Marathon:** Deep‑water crossings require new pile‑supported concrete viaducts; sea‑floor consists of compacted sand and seagrass.

## Environmental Considerations
- Alignment avoids major coral‑reef formations; all bridge spans will be designed to minimize shading and sedimentation.
- Temporary construction access will use existing causeways and barges.
- Recommended mitigation: artificial reef modules placed adjacent to new piers.

## Estimated Construction Timeline (This Segment)
- **Right‑of‑Way Acquisition:** 6 months
- **Foundation Work:** 12 months
- **Superstructure (Bridges & Embankments):** 18 months
- **Track Laying & Signaling:** 6 months
- **Total:** 42 months (3.5 years)

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Finalize right‑of‑way agreements with Monroe County and FDOT.
2. Begin detailed design of the Long Key and Seven‑Mile Bridge replacements.
3. Procure pile‑driving equipment and floating cranes.
