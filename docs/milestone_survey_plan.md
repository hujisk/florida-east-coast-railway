# Milestone: Survey and Plan the Overseas Railway to Marathon

**Issue Type:** Milestone (Sub‑issue of Epic)  
**Status:** Closed ✅  
**Created:** 2025‑12‑27  
**Completed:** 2025‑12‑27  
**Linked PR:** [#1](https://github.com/hujisk/florida-east-coast-railway/pull/1)

## Objectives
- Complete land surveys from Florida City to Marathon (approx. 45 miles).
- Secure initial right‑of‑way agreements with landowners and agencies.
- Create a preliminary track‑route plan suitable for detailed engineering.

## Detailed Tasks
1. **Topographic & Hydrographic Survey**
   - Map existing terrain, waterways, and bridge locations.
   - Identify historic railroad embankments that can be reused.
   - Document coral‑reef and seagrass‑bed boundaries to avoid.

2. **Geotechnical Investigation**
   - Core sampling at proposed bridge pier locations.
   - Assess bearing capacity of limestone bedrock and sandy fill.
   - Recommend foundation types (driven piles, spread footings).

3. **Station‑Site Selection**
   - Evaluate potential station locations for passenger access, freight logistics, and future development.
   - Select sites at Key Largo, Islamorada, Long Key, and Marathon.

4. **Preliminary Alignment**
   - Define centerline coordinates (latitude/longitude).
   - Specify gradients (max 1.5%) and curve radii (min 1,500 ft).
   - Identify bridge and viaduct requirements.

5. **Right‑of‑Way Acquisition Plan**
   - List parcels needed for the corridor.
   - Outline negotiation strategy with Monroe County, FDOT, and private owners.

## Deliverables
- `survey_report.md` – Comprehensive survey findings, station proposals, gradients, environmental notes.
- `preliminary_route.map` – Text‑based route map with mileposts and coordinates.

## Completion Evidence
The deliverables were developed on the `feature/marathon‑segment` branch and merged into `main` via PR #1 (squash‑merged). The survey report and route map are now part of the project’s official documentation.

## Closure Comment
> **Plans approved and integrated into the main project blueprint.**

## Next Steps
Proceed with **Milestone: Detailed Design and Permitting**, using the survey data as the foundation for final engineering drawings and environmental permit applications.
